# Flask-PhoneBook

An example of CRUD tasks in a database connected with python. Also, this is an example of using flask micro-framework (...-frame-work) to ilustrate as an example of web development.

This is not finish yet as it has a lot a writing errors like mixing both spanish and english in the name of the functions and routes or maybe variables set but not used.

To run it, all that you have to do is to clone the repo to your local directory and run python app.py in your terminal or cmd prompt and visit localhost:5000 in your browser.

This app can store in a sqlt3 database from users input, list all the sotred items in the database by name, phone or e-mail and also update and delete rows (contacts from the databesa).

This app runs with python 3. It has been written in python 3.

Bugs have not been found so far, so if you experience one please let me know.

Also, if you have any suggestion or advice to improve the code, please share with me. I still have a lot of doubts about the correct way of using flask and of developing in general.
